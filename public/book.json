Raised in a strict and abusive household in rural Idaho, Tara Westover never steps foot in a classroom until she is seventeen. The memoir takes readers through her incredible journey of self-education, where she battles against all odds to break free from her oppressive past and gain entry into elite universities. Her story is not only a testament to personal resilience but also a thought-provoking look at the transformative power of education and the importance of questioning what you've been taught.",

Set more than fifteen years after the original novel, The Testaments follows three narratorsâ€”Aunt Lydia, one of the founding members of the regime, and two young women with drastically different experiences within Gilead. Atwood masterfully interweaves their stories to craft a gripping tale of rebellion, loyalty, and hope. The novel explores themes of power, control, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of oppression, making it a thought-provoking and chilling follow-up to the iconic dystopian world.",
